### Tool Dataset

Due to proprietary reasons, we cannot easily open-source the tool dataset used in the experiments.

The tools are curated from [YCB](https://www.ycbbenchmarks.com/), [3DNet](https://www.acin.tuwien.ac.at/en/vision-for-robotics/software-tools/3dnet-dataset/), [KIT](https://h2t-projects.webarchiv.kit.edu/Projects/ObjectModelsWebUI/), and [GrabCAD](https://grabcad.com/).

### Manipulation environments

The environments can be found at [here](https://github.com/irom-lab/pybullet-panda/tree/corl).
